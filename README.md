# ðŸ’£ MineSweeper Game ðŸ’£

* Game codes are prepared without an interface, they are just codes designed to understand the algorithm.

* In the game, the number of rows and columns is taken from the user and the user is asked to find places that are not mines.

* The user must meet the (size - (size/4)) condition to win. In other words, if we remove the mine fields from the whole field, it must know the remaining empty matrices.
For example: in a 3x3 matrix size = 9, number of mines = 9/4 â‰¡ (int) 2
In this case, the user must choose 9-2=7 non-mine matrix in order to win.

#### The codes written are only written to understand the algorithm of the mine game.
